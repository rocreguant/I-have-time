# I-have-time

Here I'll place a small definition for each file/project

* Number-storage.py => Is a python script that generates a large number of floats and saves them in a file. With this I pretend to know which file format is better (space wise) for data storage.

* internet-parser.py => Is a python skeleton parser with the basic functionality as an idea for further data extraction.

* sideshow.html => Is a JavaScript piece of code, that shows a title, picture and description in a sideshow format. With automatic progression, pause, and manual iteration.

* founds-analysis.py => With this script I try to predict future values on some test founds using Gaussian Process (GP) and Heteroscedastic GP.
